# Nebulon

A multi-platform native Discord client, aiming to provide the usual Discord experience with less resource usage and extra quality of life features.

---

This project is still early in development and generally not usable for daily chatting, however, you can help mature this project by contributing.

### Features (as of now)

- Native performance: no more resource-hungry Chromium instances or Javascript runtimes.

And that's about it for now, but other features are planned and are being worked on:

- Background notification service: get notifications from all of your accounts without having to keep the app open and consuming memory.

- Zen mode: fullscreen a particular channel or pop it into its own window.

- Per-server theme customization: customize your interface theme per-server, or use the theme server owners provide for their server.

If you want a feature added here, you can create an issue or start working on it. Please note that features that violate Discord's terms of service won't be accepted.
